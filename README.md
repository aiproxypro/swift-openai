# Warning
This is alpha software.
I have found that the AI gets confused if I don't have headphones on.
Try with headphones first, and please let me know if you have any other issues.

# About

Use this package to add OpenAI Realtime to your swift apps.

# Installation

## Required changes to your Xcode project

- MacOS (is this necessary on iOS too?): Signing & Capabilities > Hardware > Audio Input
- Add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to Info.plist, which will autocomplete as "Privacy - Microphone Usage Description"
- Add `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` to Info.plist  <--- I'm actually not using this

## How to add this package as a dependency to your Xcode project

1. From within your Xcode project, select `File > Add Package Dependencies`

   <img src="https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift/assets/35940/d44698a0-34e6-434b-b501-390254a14439" alt="Add package dependencies" width="420">

2. Punch `github.com/aiproxypro/swift-openai` into the package URL bar, and select the 'main' branch
   as the dependency rule. Alternatively, you can choose specific releases if you'd like to have finer control of when your dependency gets updated.

## How to configure the lib for prototyping and BYOK use

If you would like to connect straight to OpenAI, use the following initialization code:

    // This is not implemented yet.
    let service = OpenAIRealtime.directService(
        unsafeOpenAIKey: "your-key-here"
    )

For production use, the above approach is only recommended if the user supplies their own API
key. Do not use a personal or company OpenAI key in the approach above. The key will get stolen
and you will get a large bill.

## How to configure the lib for a production use case

    let service = OpenAIRealtime.aiproxyService(
        serviceURL: "",
        partialKey: "",
    )

Please ensure you have followed all steps in the [integration guide](https://www.aiproxy.pro/docs/integration-guide.html).


## How to update the package

- If you set the dependency rule to `main` in step 2 above, then you can ensure the package is
  up to date by right clicking on the package and selecting 'Update Package'

  <img src="https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift/assets/35940/aeee0ab2-362b-4995-b9ca-ff4e1dd04f47" alt="Update package version" width="720">


- If you selected a version-based rule, inspect the rule in the 'Package Dependencies' section
  of your project settings:

  <img src="https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift/assets/35940/ca788c4c-ac38-4d9d-bb4f-928a9487f6eb" alt="Update package rule" width="720">

  Once the rule is set to include the release version that you'd like to bring in, Xcode should
  update the package automatically. If it does not, right click on the package in the project
  tree and select 'Update Package'.


# Example usage

    import AIProxy_OpenAI

    let service = OpenAIRealtime.aiproxyService(
        serviceURL: "service-url-from-your-developer-dashboard"
        partialKey: "partial-key-from-your-developer-dashboard",
    )


    let sessionConfiguration = RealtimeSessionUpdate.SessionConfiguration(
        inputAudioFormat: "pcm16",
        inputAudioTranscription: .init(model: "whisper-1"),
        instructions: """

    do {
        let rtSession = try await service.startRealtimeSession(sessionConfiguration)

        // Some time later...
        // await rtSession.disconnect()
    } catch {
        print("Encountered error with OpenAI realtime: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }

## Advanced Settings

### Specify your own `clientID` to annotate requests

If your app already has client or user IDs that you want to annotate AIProxy requests with,
pass a second argument to the provider's service initializer. For example:

    let service = OpenAIRealtime.aiproxyService(
        partialKey: "partial-key-from-your-developer-dashboard",
        serviceURL: "service-url-from-your-developer-dashboard",
        clientID: "<your-id>"
    )

Requests that are made using `openAIService` will be annotated on the AIProxy backend, so that
when you view top users, or the timeline of requests, your client IDs will be familiar.

If you do not have existing client or user IDs, no problem! Leave the `clientID` argument
out, and we'll generate IDs for you.


### How to catch Foundation errors for specific conditions

We use Foundation's `URL` types such as `URLRequest` and `URLSession` for all connections to
AIProxy. You can view the various errors that Foundation may raise by viewing NSURLError.h
(which is easiest to find by punching `cmd-shift-o` in Xcode and searching for it).

Some errors may be more interesting to you, and worth their own error handler to pop UI for
your user. For example, to catch `NSURLErrorTimedOut`, `NSURLErrorNetworkConnectionLost` and
`NSURLErrorNotConnectedToInternet`, you could use the following try/catch structure:

    import AIProxy

    let openAIService = AIProxy.openAIService(
        partialKey: "partial-key-from-your-developer-dashboard",
        serviceURL: "service-url-from-your-developer-dashboard"
    )

    do {
        let response = try await openAIService.chatCompletionRequest(body: .init(
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages: [.assistant(content: .text("hello world"))]
        ))
        print(response.choices.first?.message.content ?? "")
    }  catch AIProxyError.unsuccessfulRequest(let statusCode, let responseBody) {
        print("Received non-200 status code: \(statusCode) with response body: \(responseBody)")
    } catch let err as URLError where err.code == URLError.timedOut {
        print("Request for OpenAI buffered chat completion timed out")
    } catch let err as URLError where [.notConnectedToInternet, .networkConnectionLost].contains(err.code) {
        print("Could not make buffered chat request. Please check your internet connection")
    } catch {
        print("Could not get buffered chat completion: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }

# Troubleshooting


## No such module 'AIProxy' error

Occassionally, Xcode fails to automatically add the AIProxy library to your target's dependency
list.  If you receive the `No such module 'AIProxy'` error, first ensure that you have added
the package to Xcode using the [Installation steps](https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
Next, select your project in the Project Navigator (`cmd-1`), select your target, and scroll to
the `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section. Tap on the plus icon:

And add the AIProxy library:

## macOS network sandbox

If you encounter the error

    networkd_settings_read_from_file Sandbox is preventing this process from reading networkd settings file at "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkd.plist", please add an exception.

Modify your macOS project settings by tapping on your project in the Xcode project tree, then
select `Signing & Capabilities` and enable `Outgoing Connections (client)`


## 'async' call in a function that does not support concurrency

If you use the snippets above and encounter the error

    'async' call in a function that does not support concurrency

it is because we assume you are in a structured concurrency context. If you encounter this
error, you can use the escape hatch of wrapping your snippet in a `Task {}`.


## Requests to AIProxy fail in iOS XCTest UI test cases

If you'd like to do UI testing and allow the test cases to execute real API requests, you must
set the `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` env variable in your test plan **and** forward the env
variable from the test case to the host simulator (Apple does not do this by default, which I
consider a bug). Here is how to set it up:

* Set the `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` env variable in your test environment:
  - Open the scheme editor at `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme`
  - Select `Test`
  - Tap through to the test plan

    <img src="https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift/assets/35940/9a372244-f03e-4fe3-9361-ffc9d729b7d9" alt="Select test plan" width="720">

  - Select `Configurations > Environment Variables`

    <img src="https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift/assets/35940/2e042957-2c40-4335-833d-70b2bf56c31a" alt="Select env variables" width="780">

  - Add the `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` env variable with your value

    <img src="https://github.com/lzell/AIProxySwift/assets/35940/e466097c-1700-401d-add6-07c14dd26ab8" alt="Enter env variable value" width="720">

* **Important** Edit your test cases to forward on the env variable to the host simulator:

```swift
func testExample() throws {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    app.launchEnvironment = [
        "AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS": ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS"]!
    ]
    app.launch()
}
```


# FAQ


## What is the `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` constant?

AIProxy uses Apple's [DeviceCheck](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck) to ensure
that requests received by the backend originated from your app on a legitimate Apple device.
However, the iOS simulator cannot produce DeviceCheck tokens. Rather than requiring you to
constantly build and run on device during development, AIProxy provides a way to skip the
DeviceCheck integrity check. The token is intended for use by developers only. If an attacker gets
the token, they can make requests to your AIProxy project without including a DeviceCheck token, and
thus remove one level of protection.

## What is the `aiproxyPartialKey` constant?

This constant is intended to be **included** in the distributed version of your app. As the name implies, it is a
partial representation of your OpenAI key. Specifically, it is one half of an encrypted version of your key.
The other half resides on AIProxy's backend. As your app makes requests to AIProxy, the two encrypted parts
are paired, decrypted, and used to fulfill the request to OpenAI.
